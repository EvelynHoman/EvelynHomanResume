        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I'm Evelyn Homan. I'm a college student from Temecula, California. I'm currently enrolled at University of California, Riverside as a double English and Creative Writing major, with eventual career goals of being a high school English teacher and eventually a literature professor as well as a fiction writer. I currently work two jobs on campus. I am the opinions section editor for our university newspaper, The Highlander, where I am in charge of organizing articles, hiring new writers, and watching over the operations of the section as a whole. I also work as an editor on our Honors department's multidisciplinary journal, where I work with our editing team to choose which submissions will go into our journal for the year. We also decide on what our yearly theme will be and what our design layout will look like. <br><br>
        In my free time, I am passionate about my personal writing and projects. I love to work on ways to improve my productivity, and I am always looking for ways to live the best life I can. I love to cook, do yoga and read. I also enjoy listening to music and spending time with my family, friends and boyfriend. I believe that personal relationships and the relationships we have with ourselves are some of the most important we can foster. I enjoy organizing schedules, planning events, leading teams, and keeping track of everything. My planner and my bullet journal are my desk's best friends, and I always am adding to them so I can keep track of my goals and what I need to complete for my degree. <br><br> 
        I want to be a teacher because I highly value education and I believe that our country's education system needs serious reform. Though I am just one person, I hope that I can make a difference as an educator in the lives of high school and college students. I want to be an English teacher or a literature professor in particular because learning not just how to read, but why to read is one of the greatest skills that we can develop. I want to educate students on how to interpret a variety of different meanings in a work of literature, because there is no one "right" way to interpret anything, especially stories. I hope to instill a passion for critical thinking rather than a reluctant obligation to complete classwork. I hope to foster hard-working students who know that nothing is truly as black-and-white as it seems. <br><br>
        As for being a writer, I am currently in the process of working on several short stories as well as a series of novels that I hope to publish in the future through a traditional publisher. I love writing in the literary fiction and science fiction genres, and I love exploring different worlds and people through my writing. Writing has been my greatest passion for as long as I can remember, and I hope to one day share the stories I have to tell with the world. <br><br>
